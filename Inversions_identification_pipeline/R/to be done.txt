TO DO LIST:

1) check if we can get an estimate of the direction using busco genes
2) if 1) is good better then check how results vary from one window to the next
3) make plots looking at frequency of each breakpoint
4) look also how frequently when there is an inversion it contains ivory
5) start thinking of the real permutation approach

future potential refinement:
2) solve nested translocations

3) near breakpoint scan and fix? (backward check)

4) fix end translocation due to noise

5) how to handle structural variants identified but with double undefined breakpoints?
